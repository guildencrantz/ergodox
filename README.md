# EXPECTATIONS

This layout assumes that CAPSLK and ESC have been swapped at the system level (still got to use the laptop keyboard sometimes), so there really isn't a CAPSLK on Main. Additionally: I use the Dvorak layout on my systems, so some things might not make sense in Qwerty (not that I'm promising they'll make sense in Dvorak either).
